Welcome to the NASA SUITS 2025 Team GitHub. Here you will find a repo for each team. Once the SUITS team has been provided with the usernames for team members we will add them to the repo and, if you wish, we will change the repo to private.

You can find the 2024 Telemetry stream here: (NOTE: THIS IS THE OLD VERSION OF THE TSS.)
